MySQL Equivalent: http://mysql-cli.com

Quick Start
-----------

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can simply do:

::

    $ pip install pgcli

    or

    $ brew install pgcli  # Only on OS X

If you don't know how to install python packages, please check the 
`detailed instructions`__.

__ https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli#detailed-installation-instructions 

Usage
-----

:: 

    $ pgcli [database_name]

    or

    $ pgcli postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname] 

Examples: 

:: 

    $ pgcli local_database

    $ pgcli postgres://amjith:pa$$w0rd@example.com:5432/app_db

Features
--------

The `pgcli` is written using prompt_toolkit_.

* Auto-completes as you type for SQL keywords as well as tables and
  columns in the database.
* Syntax highlighting using Pygments.
* Smart-completion (enabled by default) will suggest context-sensitive
  completion.

    - ``SELECT * FROM <tab>`` will only show table names. 
    - ``SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>`` will only show column names. 

* Config file is automatically created at ``~/.config/pgcli/config`` at first launch.
* Primitive support for ``psql`` back-slash commands. 
* Pretty prints tabular data.
* Database aliases to save you from looking up or remembering connection parameters when connecting to a database. See `~/.config/pgcli/db_aliases.cfg <pgcli/db_aliases.cfg>`_ for examples.

If you're interested in contributing to this project, first of all I would like
to extend my heartfelt gratitude. I've written a small doc to describe how to
get this running in a development setup.

Detailed Installation Instructions:
-----------------------------------

OS X:
=====

Easiest way to install pgcli is using brew. Please be aware that this will
install postgres via brew if it wasn't installed via brew.

::

    $ brew install pgcli

Done!

If you have postgres installed via a different means (such as PostgresApp), you
can ``brew install --build-from-source pgcli`` which will skip installing
postgres via brew if postgres is available in the path.

Alternatively, you can install ``pgcli`` as a python package using a package
manager called called ``pip``. You will need postgres installed on your system
for this to work. 

In depth getting started guide for ``pip`` - https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html.

:: 

    $ which pip

If it is installed then you can do:

:: 

    $ pip install pgcli

If that fails due to permission issues, you might need to run the command with
sudo permissions. 

::

    $ sudo pip install pgcli

If pip is not installed check if easy_install is available on the system.

:: 

    $ which easy_install

    $ sudo easy_install pgcli

Linux:
======

In depth getting started guide for ``pip`` - https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html.

Check if pip is already available in your system.

:: 

    $ which pip

If it doesn't exist, use your linux package manager to install `pip`. This
might look something like: 

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip   # Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc

    or

    $ sudo yum install python-pip  # RHEL, Centos, Fedora etc

``pgcli`` requires python-dev, libpq-dev and libevent-dev packages. You can
install these via your operating system package manager. 


::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev libpq-dev libevent-dev

    or 

    $ sudo yum install python-devel postgresql-devel

Then you can install pgcli: 

:: 

    $ sudo pip install pgcli


Thanks:
-------

A special thanks to `Jonathan Slenders <https://twitter.com/jonathan_s>`_ for
creating `Python Prompt Toolkit <http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`_, 
which is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible.
Jonathan has also provided valuable feedback and support during the development
of this app.

This app includes the awesome `tabulate <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate>`_ 
library for pretty printing the output of tables. The reason for vendoring this
library rather than listing it as a dependency in setup.py, is because I had to
make a change to the table format which is merged back into the original repo,
but not yet released in PyPI.

`Click <http://click.pocoo.org/3/>`_ is used for command line option parsing
and printing error messages.

Thanks to `psycopg <http://initd.org/psycopg/>`_ for providing a rock solid
interface to Postgres database.

Thanks to all the beta testers and contributors for your time and patience. :)
